            To put it simply, Pixel Painter is a clone of your standard paint
            program. It has simple low-res graphics and a small variety of ways
            to interact with the canvas. This project was the cumulation of all
            the knowledge I had gained from the smaller game-dev focused
            projects I had made whilst building this engine. The only libraries
            I used for the project was the built-in java library for creating a
            window context, and the library for loading raw image data. I worked
            on PixelPainter for a couple months in 2019, during my Sophmore year
            in highschool.
            <br /><br />
            I decided to go with a the low-res theme for the project for a
            couple reasons. First off, it was much easier for me to make the
            icons and textures for everything that I needed when I only had a
            couple pixels to be dealing with (I'm not very good at art).
            Additionally, I also had some experience with making low-res
            textures from when I used to make Minecraft resource packs and
            scripts for fun.

            The painter hosts a lot of the common features you'd find in any
            paint program. It has the following tools for writing pixels to the
            canvas: Pen, Circle, Dot, and Line. It also has a size option that
            changes the line width for the line and circle tool, and the brush
            size for the pen tool. There is also a limited color selector that
            lets you choose from 8 different colors. One of these colors (the
            background color) can be used with any tool to erase parts of the
            canvas. There is also a transluscent blue color that can be blended
            with the canvas. Drawing is done by clicking on the canvas. Dragging
            the cursor allows you to adjust the size or direction of the object
            you are drawing.
            <br /><br />
            PixelPainter also has an undo and redo tool in the top right, which
            can be used to undo or redo any edits to the canvas. There is a
            reset button to clear the canvas. The painter also has limited
            saving functionality. The save button opens a moveable window with
            an option to confirm whether or not you want to save the painting. I
            planned to add additional functionlity to this window, such as
            choosing a file name and directory, but never got around to it. In
            its current state the save button saves images to a file in the same
            directory as the program.

          <h2>How was it made?</h2>
          <p>
            I mentioned previously that PixelPainter is built using a custom
            game engine. This game engine was built in Java, but I converted and
            added a lot of features to support this project. Namely, the UI
            system was extended a lot during this project to allow for the use
            of radio buttons, toggles, and draggable window popups. I also added
            a completely custom event system, which was used extensively by both
            the new UI elements, as well as the history (undo and redo) system.
            This event system was heavily inspired by the spigot api, which is
            used to create plugins for Minecraft servers.
            <br /><br />
            This project is completely software-rendered, as it pre-dates my
            experience with OpenGL (and other graphics libraries). As such, all
            rendering is handled by a simple array of colors, and a bunch of
            functions that can rasterize pixels onto that array. The renderer
            can draw dots, lines, circles, squares, images, and custom fonts.
            <br /><br />
            This project was heavily inspired by the

              >Majoolwip 2D Java Game engine series</a
            >. Their series provided an extensive amount of direction that was
            extremely helpful when I first became interested in game
            development. The engine is inspired by the one built in Majoolwip's
            series, and wouldn't have been possible without it. If you're
            interested in building your own software-rendered game engine, I
            would heavily recommend this series.
