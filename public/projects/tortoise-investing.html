            The Tortoise Investing tool was created by a team of myself and
            three others during the
            <a href="https://www.grizzhacks.org/">GrizzHacks 6</a> 24-hour
            hackathon. It was designed to be an educational tool to introduce
            the dollar cost averaging investment strategy to an audience of
            people who were either new or wary to investing. It accomplishes
            this in two ways. First, it explains how the strategy works using
            simple terms. Secondly, it gives the user access to an interactive
            simulation. This simulation lets you select a stock ticker of
            choice, a time period between each investment, and an amount of
            money to invest per period time. Then the results are shown in a
            graph, comparing how much money the user would have had at any one
            point in time should they have followed either the dca strategy, or
            put the same amount of money into a savings account.

          <h2>How was it made?</h2>
          <p>
            This webapp was made using
            <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/">NextJS</a> for the
            backend/frontend. We also used tailwind for the styling, and
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chartjs.org/">ChartJS</a> for
            the chart displays. It works by accessing a yahoo finance api that
            provides us with historical stock price data in the csv format. We
            then parse this data and simulate the dca investment strategy on the
            backend before sending it to the client component containing the
            chart on the front end. <br /><br />
            This was admittedly a very simple project for a hackathon, but we
            intentionally made this decision so we could focus more on UI and
            some other events like the CTF that was hosted, which turned out
            really well for us.
